# 2D Physics Sandbox
This is an application for experimenting with 2D physics motion and collision algorithms. I don't have much of an end goal as this is mostly an educational project.
## Tech Stack
* Rust: We all love Rust ðŸ¦€ðŸ§¡
* GLFW: Creates windows and GL contexts plus handles user inputs across multiple platforms
* Skia: Draw shapes in the simulation
* (Potential Future Addition) Dear ImGui: Draw basic user interface
